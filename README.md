# ESPS_Algorithm
auther : abubakarcool
This is application is created in C++ .net and it is 'Efficient Single Pattern Searching Algorithm'. This Searching algorithm is improved by adopting binary search tree and SDBM hash function techniques. These techniques are applied to make fast the search time to find a unique key for each pattern in the text.
